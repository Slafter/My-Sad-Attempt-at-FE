# My-Sad-Attempt-at-FE

Fire Emblem is a turn based strategy RPG series developed by Intelligent Systems. None of their games have a decent multiplayer mode.

My Sad Attempt at FE is a quick multiplayer game with enhanced strategy elements and diminished RPG elements based off of Intelligent System's Fire Emblem. It's created using Blizzard Entertainment's Galaxy Editor to take advantage their free online service, the Starcraft 2 Arcade.

I started this project a couple years ago with little knowledge of Galaxy, hence the lack of enthusiasm in the name of the game. It's still a work in progress but most of the major systems are functional.

To open the map file you'll need to download Starcraft 2 (the arcade starter edition is free) which will include the Galaxy Editor. You can learn about the free Arcade Starter Edition here: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/12440015 and download the game here: https://us.battle.net/account/activation/landing.html?product=S2&trial
